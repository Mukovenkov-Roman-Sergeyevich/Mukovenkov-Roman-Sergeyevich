# 💖 My Super Sparkly~✨ Journey into the World of FPGAs! 💖

Hiii everyone! (´｡• ᵕ •｡`) ♡ While all the other language-chans are gossiping about sparkly "Possibilities," our dear OCaml-chan 🎀🐫 is busy, diligently weaving a fluffy ribbon 🎗️ of pure "Truth"!

And just like her, I went on a journey to find the truth in the world of hardware! It's a world of little bits and true parallelism, and I want to share my adventure with you!~ Let's go! 🎉

## 📖 My Story So Far...

### My First Sparkle ✨ (Before Coursework)
A long, long time ago... I had a tiny, tiny 🌱 bit of experience with FPGAs! I played with a Gowin FPGA at a summer school, making a little state machine with buttons 🔴. It was my first time saying "Hello!" 👋 to SystemVerilog! ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ

### My Big Coursework Adventure! 🚀 (LiteX & SCR1)
This was my masterpiece! I protected my coursework on [adding the SCR1 core to the LiteX automatic SoC build system](https://github.com/Mukovenkov-Roman-Sergeyevich/scr1-colorlight-i9-litex)!

What's that, you ask? (・о・) Well, usually you have to manually connect a SystemVerilog core to all the special parts of an FPGA board (memory, caches, timers, buses...). It's a lot of work! 🥵

But with their automated way, you just tell the system what resources the board has, and *poof*! 🪄 It connects everything for you! It's like **plug-n-play, build-your-own-computer-chan online!** So easy and fun! 🖥️💕 It's perfect for prototyping to see if you have enough resources or if there are any conflicts. Cheap and fast, in the best way!

I made a donut spin on the FPGA, travel through the adapter, and show up in my computer's console! It was SO COOL! Donut-kun, rock on! 🍩💖

### YADRO's Digital Circuit School! 🏫
During my second year, I went to the [School of Digital Circuit Synthesis](https://engineer.yadro.com/chip-design-school/)! All the lectures are [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqDmnd8PoScGaBbwnbsyy1g). It was amazing for learning SystemVerilog and hardware architecture 🧠💻 with a focus on practice! We learned about cache coherence, pipelining, and educational systems. I **absolutely LOVED ❤️** the homework on pipeline conflicts. It's a must-have for this field! At the end, there was a party with pizza and a cute over the shoulder bag! 🍕👜

### My C-Language Power! 💪💖
Oh, how I envy C-chan! (//ω//) I love her simplicity! And I especially love how her code becomes almost predictable assembly instructions 📜⚙️. It's like you can see the hardware's true feelings right there! My university projects were just a little hello, but the technical assignments were where our friendship started to sparkle. Now, I dream that at work, that little sparkle will grow into an overpowering shine! ✨

### Final Musings... 💭

I'm just happy to be close to C-chan! Together, we will build (and verify!) great things 🛠️. Great things indeed! ⛩️🎀
